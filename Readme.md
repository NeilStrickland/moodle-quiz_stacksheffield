# STACK question reporting

This Moodle quiz reporting module provides bespoke reports for the
STACK question type.  It is cannibalised from an earlier module with
the same purpose created by Tim Hunt and Chris Sangwin.  This version
is designed for use with the Sheffield forks of STACK and the
adaptivemultipart question behhaviour.
