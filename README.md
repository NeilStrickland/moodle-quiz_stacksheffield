# moodle-quiz_stacksheffield
A Moodle quiz report with detailed analysis of responses to STACK questions

This is alpha quality code which relies on forked versions of STACK and the adaptivemultipart question behaviour, and also on ad hoc features of the questions that we are using in Sheffield.  We do not recommend that you should use this plugin unless you are willing to dive deeply into the code.
